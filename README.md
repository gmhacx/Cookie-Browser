# Cookie-Browser
Coded to use it in an old IXWare version, it's a browser using CefSharp & WinForms, make sure to add all dependencies (dll's etc. from CefSharp) in the "bin" folder. Bin folder must be in the same folder as the exe file. 

# Note
Not sure if it still works as it used to be, test it our yourself.
